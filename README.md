# apocalypsewow
A UChicago Scav apocalyptic security alert generator 

Exactly what it says on the tin! This little web app generates text blocks that sounds like UChicago Security alerts but if the apocalypse were in progress. It uses Javascript to generate text blocks that compile random elements of different arrays of apocalyptic-sounding imagery, and uses Date objects to generate randomized dates during Scav 2018.
